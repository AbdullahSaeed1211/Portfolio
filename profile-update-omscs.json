  "aboutMe": {
    "intro": "I'm an AI-focused software engineer and published IEEE researcher with a commitment to bridging academic research and real-world system implementation through machine learning and distributed computing.",
    "academicProfile": "I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Amity University (2021–2025), graduating with a CGPA of 8.48/10 and Merit Scholar recognition. My academic foundation includes rigorous coursework in Data Structures Using C, Analysis & Design of Algorithms, Database Management Systems, Operating Systems, Theory of Computation, Compiler Construction, Distributed Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Generative AI, Software Engineering, Object Oriented System Design, and Cyber Security. My research output includes two IEEE conference papers featuring novel approaches to medical AI and semantic search optimization—demonstrating both theoretical innovation and practical implementation capabilities.",
    "researchFocus": "My research interests center on applied machine learning for healthcare, distributed system optimization, and human-computer interaction. My published work includes a ResNet50-based brain tumor detection system achieving 94.2% accuracy improvement and a semantic indexing algorithm improving query response times by 40%. I've successfully translated academic research into production systems serving 100+ users with enterprise-grade reliability.",
    "leadershipNote": "Beyond academic pursuits, I founded Kiiro.cx, delivering 8+ AI-enhanced web solutions to international clients across UAE, US, and UK markets. I also lead technical workshops and mentor junior developers, contributing to the broader CS education ecosystem through Google Developer Student Club initiatives.",
    "omscsIntent": "I'm applying to Georgia Tech's OMSCS program to advance my research capabilities in Machine Learning and Computing Systems while contributing to cutting-edge research in distributed AI systems. OMSCS will provide the theoretical foundation and research mentorship needed to transition into PhD-level research or senior engineering roles in AI infrastructure at leading technology companies."
